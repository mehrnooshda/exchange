# Crypto Purchase Platform

This project provides an API to allow users to purchase cryptocurrencies using their account balance. The platform 
supports the purchase of several cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, ADA, and more. The backend is built using Django and 
Django Rest Framework, and the project can be easily deployed using Docker. 

## Features

- **User Management**:
Users can create accounts and manage their balance.
- **Purchase Cryptocurrencies**: Users can buy supported cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, etc.) if they have sufficient balance.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error messages for unsupported coins, insufficient balance, and invalid user IDs.
- **Testing**: The project is tested using DRFâ€™s test framework.

## Tech Stack

- Django: Web framework for building the application.
- Django Rest Framework (DRF): For building the RESTful API.
- Docker: Containerization for the application, making it easy to deploy across environments.
- In Memory Queue: which can easily be replaced with Redis queue to store pending purchase requests.
